"We were once great, but we have a new threat"
==============================================================================

Palpatine:
Citizens of the civilized galaxy, on this day we mark a transition. For a
thousand years, the Republic stood as the crowning achievement of civilized
beings. But there were those who would set us against one another, and we took
up arms to defend our way of life against the Separatists. In so doing, we
never suspected that the greatest threat came from within.

Trump:
Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on
our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life.
Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.
Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of
violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. Many have witnessed
this violence personally, some have even been its victims.
(lines 11-16)

==============================================================================
"We are honest, but our enemies are not"
==============================================================================

Palpatine:
The Jedi, and some within our own Senate, had conspired to create the shadow of
Separatism using one of their own as the enemy's leader. They had hoped to
grind the Republic into ruin. But the hatred in their hearts could not be
hidden forever. At last, there came a day when our enemies showed their true
natures.

Trump:
So if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and
the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week.

But here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the
American people with the truth, and nothing else.
(lines 28-32)

America is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by
a group of censors, critics, and cynics.

Remember: all of the people telling you that you can’t have the country you
want, are the same people telling you that I wouldn’t be standing here tonight.
No longer can we rely on those elites in media, and politics, who will say
anything to keep a rigged system in place.
(lines 455-461)

==============================================================================
"I have a plan for dealing with our vague shadowy enemies and their plans"
==============================================================================

Palpatine:
The Jedi hoped to unleash their destructive power against the Republic by
assassinating the head of government and usurping control of the clone army.
But the aims of would-be tyrants were valiantly opposed by those without
elitist, dangerous powers. Our loyal clone troopers contained the insurrection
within the Jedi Temple and quelled uprisings on a thousand worlds.

Trump:
This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction and
weakness.

But Hillary Clinton’s legacy does not have to be America’s legacy. The
problems we face now – poverty and violence at home, war and destruction
abroad – will last only as long as we continue relying on the same
politicians who created them. A change in leadership is required to change
these outcomes. Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America.
(lines 117-124)

==============================================================================
"Things are about to change in the near future if I am elected"
==============================================================================

Palpatine:
The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated! Any collaborators will
suffer the same fate. These have been trying times, but we have passed the
test. The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed, but I assure
you my resolve has never been stronger. The war is over. The Separatists have
been defeated, and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the
threshold of a new beginning.

Trump:
The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is
that our plan will put America First. Americanism, not globalism, will be our
credo. As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First,
then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect.
This will all change in 2017.
(lines 126-130)

I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts
our nation will soon come to an end. Beginning on January 20th 2017, safety
will be restored.
(lines 18-20)

==============================================================================
"I wil restore order and unify the nation through the arm of the law"
==============================================================================

Palpatine:
In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic will
be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society,
which I assure you will last for ten thousand years. An Empire that will
continue to be ruled by this august body and a sovereign ruler chosen for life.
An Empire ruled by the majority, ruled by a new constitution!

By bringing the entire galaxy under one law, one language, and the enlightened
guidance of one individual, the corruption that plagued the Republic in its
later years will never take root. Regional governors will eliminate the
bureaucracy that allowed the Separatist movement to grow unchecked. A strong
and growing military will ensure the rule of law.

Under the Empire's New Order, our most cherished beliefs will be safeguarded.
We will defend our ideals by force of arms. We will give no ground to our
enemies and will stand together against attacks from within or without. Let the
enemies of the Empire take heed: those who challenge Imperial resolve will be
crushed.

Trump:
Together, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead
our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace. We will be a country of
generosity and warmth. But we will also be a country of law and order.
(lines 7-9)

I will work with, and appoint, the best prosecutors and law enforcement
officials in the country to get the job done. In this race for the White House,
I am the Law And Order candidate. The irresponsible rhetoric of our President,
who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has
made America a more dangerous environment for everyone.
(lines 216-220)

==============================================================================
"People will join us because we are right"
==============================================================================

Palpatine:
We have taken on a task that will be difficult, but the people of the Empire
are ready for the challenge. Because of our efforts, the galaxy has traded war
for peace and anarchy for stability. Billions of beings now look forward to a
secure future. The Empire will grow as more planets feel the call, from the Rim
to the wilds of unknown space.

Trump:
I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up
on people that cannot defend themselves. Nobody knows the system better than
me, which is why I alone can fix it. I have seen firsthand how the system is
rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders –
he never had a chance.

But his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest
issue: trade. Millions of Democrats will join our movement because we are
going to fix the system so it works for all Americans.
(lines 185-193)

==============================================================================
"We will build wonderous things"
==============================================================================

Palpatine:
Imperial citizens must do their part. Join our grand star fleet. Become the
eyes of the Empire by reporting suspected insurrectionists. Travel to the
corners of the galaxy to spread the principles of the New Order to barbarians.
Build monuments and technical wonders that will speak of our glory for   
generations to come.

Trump:
The American People will come first once again. My plan will begin with
safety at home – which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and
protection from terrorism. There can be no prosperity without law and order.
On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and
trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.
(lines 132-136)

==============================================================================
"Be patriotic and support our country"
==============================================================================

Palpatine:
The clone troopers, now proudly wearing the name of Imperial stormtroopers,
have tackled the dangerous work of fighting our enemies on the front lines.
Many have died in their devotion to the Empire. Imperial citizens would
do well to remember their example.

Trump:
I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values
and love our people.
(lines 267-268)

==============================================================================
"I am the only choice to be your leader"
==============================================================================

Palpatine:
The New Order of peace has triumphed over the shadowy secrecy of shameful
magicians. The direction of our course is clear. I will lead the Empire to
glories beyond imagining.

Trump:
I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up
on people that cannot defend themselves. Nobody knows the system better than
me, which is why I alone can fix it. I have seen firsthand how the system is
rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders –
he never had a chance.
(lines 185-189)

I AM YOUR VOICE.
(line 157)

==============================================================================
"We will be victorious, and become greater than our once-great greatness"
==============================================================================

Palpatine:
We have been tested, but we have emerged stronger. We move forward as one
people: the Imperial citizens of the first Galactic Empire. We will prevail.
Ten thousand years of peace begins today.

Trump:
It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back – bigger, and better
and stronger than ever before.
(lines 430-431)

To all Americans tonight, in all our cities and towns, I make this promise:
We Will Make America Strong Again.
We Will Make America Proud Again.
We Will Make America Safe Again.
And We Will Make America Great Again.
(lines 480-484)
